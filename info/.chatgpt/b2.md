As a software developer, I would suggest the following architecture for developing an easy-to-use virtual closet app:

1. **Frontend**: The frontend of the app can be developed using **React**. React is a popular JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. It is fast, efficient, and easy to use. React also has a large community of developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

2. **Backend**: The backend of the app can be developed using **Node.js**. Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime environment that is used to build scalable and high-performance applications. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

3. **Database**: The database for the app can be developed using **MongoDB**. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is used to store and manage large amounts of data. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

4. **Authentication**: The authentication for the app can be developed using **OAuth 2.0**. OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization that is used to provide secure access to user data. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

5. **Image Processing**: The ability to take photos of clothing items and remove the background can be developed using **OpenCV**. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that is used to process images and videos. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

6. **Clothes Organization**: The clothes organization feature can be developed using **React DnD**. React DnD is a popular drag and drop library that is used to build complex drag and drop interfaces. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

7. **Clothes Search**: The clothes search feature can be developed using **Elasticsearch**. Elasticsearch is a popular search engine that is used to search and analyze large amounts of data. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

8. **Weather Integration**: The weather integration feature can be developed using **OpenWeatherMap API**. OpenWeatherMap API is a popular weather API that is used to retrieve weather data. It is also easy to use and has a large community of developers.

I hope this architecture helps you in developing an easy-to-use virtual closet app. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
